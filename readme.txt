Integrates with the iOS Presscheck application allowing you to keep track of your site\'s security updates from your phone or watch.

== Description ==
Perfect for those managing multiple wordpress sites, Presscheck integrates with the iOS Presscheck application (https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1073490547&mt=8). This allows you to quickly view whether any of your wordpress sites have updates required, and all from the same screen. Turn on notifications on your iOS device or watch and the app will alert you when new updates are required so (as long as you then actually go update) you\'ll never have out of date and insecure installations.

== Installation ==
Install this application either through the WP Admin interface or uploading the plugin to your wp-content/plugins folder. You\'ll need to also install the companion iOS application to your iPhone (https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1073490547&mt=8)
